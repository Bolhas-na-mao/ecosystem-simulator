# Ecosystem Simulator

> Languages: [PortuguÃªs (BR)](README.md) | **English**

A simulation game where you manage an ecosystem with grass, rabbits, and foxes.

## How It Works

### Grass

- Grows naturally on empty cells over time
- Serves as food for rabbits

### Rabbits

- Move toward grass when detected within range
- Eat grass when adjacent, gaining energy
- Lose energy each turn
- Die when energy reaches zero
- Reproduce when they reach maximum energy (instead of moving)

### Foxes

- Move toward rabbits when detected within range
- Eat rabbits when adjacent, gaining energy
- Lose energy each turn
- Die when energy reaches zero
- Reproduce when they reach maximum energy (instead of moving)

## Objective

Balance the ecosystem by strategically placing and managing entities to keep all species alive as long as possible.

## How to Play

1. Place grass, rabbits, and foxes on the map
2. Start the simulation
3. Observe the ecosystem dynamics
4. Intervene when necessary to maintain balance
